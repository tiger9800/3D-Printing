## This file could also use some refactoring
## I would suggest rename it into API calls (and make a class)
## make all the functions here associated only with API calls
## all other stuff can go to utils
## URL and token can be global variables or class fields as they are constant
## you can name the functions: post_trial and post_record (to reflect the http request)
## you can make functions post_trial and post_record smaller by extracting some logic to utils
